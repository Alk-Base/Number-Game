# Number Game
A simple CLI-based number-guessing game written in Python

## How to Run

Make sure you have Python installed, then run:

```bash
python number-game.py
```
or:

```bash
python3 number-game.py
```
# How it works:
The game picks a random number between 1 and 100
You choose a difficulty level
You guess the number within a limited number of attempts
The game tells you whether your guess is higher or lower

# First project, by the way. I'll be updating it with new features as I learn a bit more.
